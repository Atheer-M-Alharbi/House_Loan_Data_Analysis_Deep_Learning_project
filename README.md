# House_Loan_Data_Analysis_Deep_Learning_project

**Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow**

**DESCRIPTION**
For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.


**Objective:** Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

**Domain:** Finance
